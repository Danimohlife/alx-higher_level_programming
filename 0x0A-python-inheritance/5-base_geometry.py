class BaseGeometry:
    """
    A base class for geometric operations.

    This class serves as a foundation for more
    specific geometry-related classes.
    Currently, it does not implement any methods or
    attributes but can be extended
    in future subclasses.

    Example:
        >>> bg = BaseGeometry()
        >>> isinstance(bg, BaseGeometry)
        True
    """
    pass
